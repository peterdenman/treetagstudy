# treetagstudy
retention rate analysis for tree tags inside of anki. calculates true retention based on selected tag category instead of anki deck default. 

Standard Anki statistics focus on Decks. This add-on focuses on Tags, allowing you to drill down into your retention rates based on tag hierarchy.

Manual Installation (Development Mode)
1. Open Anki and navigate to Tools -> Add-ons -> View Files.
2. Create a new folder named treetagstudy.
3. Download this repository and place the __init__.py file inside that folder.
4. Restart Anki.

Usage
1. Open the tool by going to Tools --> Check Tag Tree
2. Type a parent tag to analyze (e.g., #AK_Step1_v12, #Bootcamp, or #Endocrine)
3. Expand folders to see sub-tree tag stats
   
**IMPORTANT** I cannot guarantee this will not delete or corrupt your Anki. Please backup your Anki. You can do this automatically and send to the AnkiWeb server.
